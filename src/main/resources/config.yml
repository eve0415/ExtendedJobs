# This is the default configuration file for the plugin.
# You can edit this file to change the settings of the plugin.

# This configuration defines crafting and interaction restrictions for specific jobs in a whitelist format. Please note the following rules:
#
#  1. Whitelist System: Only items and blocks explicitly listed under each jobâ€™s craft and interact sections can be crafted or interacted with by that job.
#  2. Exclusive Restrictions: If a job is allowed to craft a specific item or interact with a specific block, all other jobs are restricted from doing so unless explicitly stated otherwise.
#  3. Multiple Job Permissions: If the same item or block is listed under multiple jobs, each of those jobs will be allowed to craft or interact with it.
#  4. Unrestricted Items/Blocks: Any item or block that is *not listed* under any job will be accessible to all jobs without restriction.

# Job Name is Case Sensitive
# Craft: Items that can be crafted by the job
# Interact: Blocks that can be interacted with by the job
# Place: Blocks that can be placed by the job
